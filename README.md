# Calculator_Sara-Sanvi

This ReadMe entails our plans for the MVC Calculator pt 2.

Over the past two weeks, we have focused on learning, adjusting, understanding, and coding with IntelliJ and GitHub. Mr. M requested that we are able to create an appealing, unique calculator that is both text-based and UI-based.

Here is our plan to accomplish this goal:
1. Deep analysis of Mr. M's current calculator code; although we did look through the code last week, I(Sara) would like to review the code chunk by chunk and add comments to better understand how each line, each letter of Mr. M's code works. Since I am relatively new to Java, I will also refer to resources online such as forums and YouTube videos.

2. Grasp of how to use the Swing Designer on Java. For the past couple of days, I(Sara) have been working on using Swing Designer to create a JFrame for the calculator. It took hours of searching the internet, reading forums, and just trial and error to configure the calculator GUI to the one visible in the CalculatorGUI file. I learned a lot in the process, such as the purpose of each component and how to obtain the look you want.

3. Determine a method to connect the text-based calculator to the UI-based one. This was a difficult concept for me(Sara) as well as the scrum team to understand. My idea is that we will create separate classes that can be changed by the user with the click of a button.

Since we are in a scrum team with Nakul, Vihan, and Yasaswi, we all discussed potential ways to meet Mr. M's requirements. We think that our code should potentially have these components:
1. An operations class. This is essential for both the text-based and UI-based calculators. Either way, they need the operations to actually perform their tasks. This class can be used for both calculators.

2. We also need a Main class that will connect the text and GUI classes. Potentially through the click of a button, the main menu will enable the user to alternate between the two types of calculators.

3. Create a class for taking input from the console line - CLI.

4. Create a class for taking input from GUI.

This is our plan for the calculator as of right now. We believe this project will take us a minimum of one week to finish as we would like to grasp every corner of this assignment by the time we need to submit it.
