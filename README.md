# Calculator_Sara-Sanvi

This ReadMe entails our plans for the MVC Calculator pt 2.

Over the past two weeks, we have focused on learning, adjusting, understanding, and coding with IntelliJ and GitHub. Mr. M requested that we are able to create an appealing, unique calculator that is both text-based and UI-based.

Here is our plan to accomplish this goal:
1. Deep analysis of Mr. M's current calculator code; although we did look through the code last week, I(Sara) would like to review the code chunk by chunk and add comments to better understand how each line, each letter of Mr. M's code works. Since I am relatively new to Java, I will also refer to resources online such as forums and YouTube videos.

2. Grasp of how to use the Swing Designer on Java. For the past couple of days, I(Sara) have been working on using Swing Designer to create a JFrame for the calculator. It took hours of searching the internet, reading forums, and just trial and error to configure the calculator GUI to the one visible in the CalculatorGUI file. I learned a lot in the process, such as the purpose of each component and how to obtain the look you want.

3. Determine a method to connect the text-based calculator to the UI-based one. This was a difficult concept for me(Sara) as well as the scrum team to understand. My idea is that we will create separate classes that can be changed by the user with the click of a button.
